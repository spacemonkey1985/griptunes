            	<h2>about</h2>
                <b>mission</b><br />
                To spread the <b>gospel, reach out</b> to strangers, <b>inspire</b> each other and remain <b>positive</b>
                <br /><br />
                <b>goal</b><br />
                <b>G.R.I.P</b> is an acronym for <b>gospel, reachout, inspiration, positive</b><br />
				Our business is to promote words and actions that fall within the G.R.I.P bracket. <br />
				As the saying goes - <i>"Garbage in, garbage out"</i>. 
                <br /><br />
                <b>why blog?</b><br /> 
				The blog aims to consistently fill the readersâ€™ minds with <b>G.R.I.P</b> thoughts. Thoughts that will provoke <b>G.R.I.P</b> actions, The blog was started to uplift hearts, awaken dreams and it has been the perfect platform to set off on our mission. The blog is a very integral part of what we do and will always be. 
				<br /><br />
				We aim to deliver at least seven write ups every month. 
                <br /><br />
                <b>why lyrics?</b><br />
				We are what we speak. The words that roll off our tongue have the power of life and death. Music is words with a rhythm, so we need not get carried away with the sweet, bouncy rhythm and sing words we would not speak on a regular basis. Negative words will have an adverse effect on our life, so we need to be cautious on what we hear and eventually speak.<br /><br />
				We aim to grow the largest lyrics database that will include only songs that are in line with our mission (as stated above).
				<br /><br />
                <b>how?</b><br />
                We aim to grow this lyrics database with the help of our dedicated staff and users like you. You can add lyrics you feel inspire you and may inspire others.<br /> 
				We will accept lyrics in any language and will appreciate it if you send the interpretation as well.<br />
				We aim to review every uploaded lyric by the user to ensure they are as accurate as can be and also fall under the G.R.I.P bracket. You can edit any lyric that is wrong or contact us and we will act duly. <br />
				We welcome your ideas & suggestions as they will help us grow and serve you better. We are on a long journey to ensure the music industry becomes pure and I am sure you will want to be a part of it.<br />
				We appreciate your support in spreading the news of the existence of this website by word of mouth, sharing it on social networks, your personal web pages and every possible means.
                <br /><br />
				<b>At this point we will like to say thank you to every user, every viewer, every artiste, every blogger and every contributor; THANK YOU.</b>
